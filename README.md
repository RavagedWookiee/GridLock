# GridLock

**Project Gridlock is a strategic simulation set in a post-apocalyptic world where players are tasked with reclaiming and rebuilding a city amidst the ruins. The game combines elements of urban planning, resource management, and tactical defense strategies. Players develop technologies across four key categories—Military/Defenses, Resources, Infrastructure, and Engineering—to enhance their capabilities and secure their settlements. The tech tree drives progression, offering advancements like improved fortifications, efficient resource utilization, and innovative engineering solutions. Key features include dynamic building health adjustments influenced by player-discovered technologies and a sophisticated system for managing the skills and efficiencies of characters, known as 'pips', who are critical to the city's revival. The goal is to survive, thrive, and expand in a harsh, resource-scarce environment, utilizing both the remnants of the old world and new innovations to forge a sustainable future.**
